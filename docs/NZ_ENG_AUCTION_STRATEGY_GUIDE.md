| **Wicket** | 20 points | High-value; prioritize wicket-takers |
| **Catch** | 10 points | Bonus for good fielders |
| **Stumping** | 25 points | Premium value for wicket-keepers |
| **Run Out** | 20 points | Athletic fielders add extra value |

**Milestone bonuses are DISABLED for this auction:**
- ❌ No half-century bonus (+10 pts)

## 🚨 Auction Day Tips

### Before Auction Starts
1. **Plan Your Targets**: List 8-10 players in priority order
2. **Set Max Budgets**: Know your walk-away price for each player
3. **Watch Competitors**: Track opponents' budgets and roster gaps

### During Auction
- **45-Second Timer**: Bid quickly on priority targets; delay on unwanted players
- **Anti-Snipe (15s)**: Timer resets if bid placed in final 15 seconds - use strategically
- **Budget Discipline**: Don't blow 60%+ of budget on 2 players unless elite
- **Roster Balance**: Avoid 5 batsmen + 1 bowler; diversify point sources

### Red Flags
- ❌ Spending >£150m on a single player (25% budget)
- ❌ Ignoring wicket-takers (lowest point potential)
- ❌ Loading up on specialist batsmen only
- ❌ Forgetting to bid on wicket-keeper (high stumping value)

## 🏆 Winning Mindset

### Key Principles
1. **Wickets > Runs**: 20 pts per wicket vs 1 pt per run
2. **All-Rounders = Value**: Multiple point sources per slot
3. **Wicket-Keepers = Premium**: Stumping points (25 pts) are elite
4. **No Milestone Chasing**: Steady performers beat boom-or-bust

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Overpaying for pure batsmen (limited to run-scoring only)
- Ignoring fielding specialists (catches/run-outs add up)
- Panic-buying late (desperation = overspending)
- Rigid planning (adapt to auction flow)
