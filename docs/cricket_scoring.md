# Cricket Scoring System

## Overview

The Friends of Pifa cricket scoring system provides comprehensive points calculation for cricket player performances across matches. Commissioners can customize scoring rules per league while maintaining consistent calculation logic.

## Default Scoring Rules

### Base Points per Action
| Action | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Run** | 1 point | Per run scored |
| **Wicket** | 25 points | Per wicket taken (bowling) |
| **Catch** | 10 points | Per catch taken (fielding) |
| **Stumping** | 15 points | Per stumping (wicket-keeping) |
| **Run Out** | 10 points | Per run out (fielding/backing up) |

### Milestone Bonuses
| Milestone | Threshold | Bonus Points | Auto-Applied |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Half Century** | 50+ runs | +10 points | ✅ Enabled |
| **Century** | 100+ runs | +25 points | ✅ Enabled |
| **Five Wicket Haul** | 5+ wickets | +25 points | ✅ Enabled |

**Note:** Milestone bonuses are cumulative. A century (101 runs) earns both half-century (+10) and century (+25) bonuses.

## Scoring Upload Process

### For Commissioners

1. **Prepare CSV Data**
   - Use the exact column headers: `matchId,playerExternalId,runs,wickets,catches,stumpings,runOuts`
   - Ensure `playerExternalId` matches seeded cricket players (e.g., `virat_kohli`, `ms_dhoni`)
   - Use consistent `matchId` format (e.g., `IPL_2024_M001`)

2. **Upload via API** (UI coming soon)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-domain/api/scoring/{leagueId}/ingest" \
        -F "file=@cricket_scores.csv"
   ```

3. **Verify Results**
   - Check leaderboard: `GET /api/scoring/{leagueId}/leaderboard`
   - Re-uploading same CSV gives identical totals (no double counting)

### Key Features
- **Upsert Logic**: Same match + player combination updates existing score
- **No Double Counting**: Re-uploading identical data maintains same totals
- **Multi-Match Support**: Points accumulate across different matches
- **Instant Updates**: Leaderboard updates immediately after upload

## Custom Scoring Overrides

Commissioners can customize scoring rules per league through the **Advanced: Scoring (Cricket)** panel in League Settings.

### Customizable Elements

**Base Points:**
- Adjust points per run, wicket, catch, stumping, run out
- Supports decimal values (e.g., 1.5 points per run)

**Milestone Controls:**
- Enable/disable individual milestones
- Customize bonus points for each milestone
- Thresholds are fixed (50 for half-century, 100 for century, 5 for five-wicket haul)

### Example Custom Configuration
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "run": 2,
    "wicket": 30,
    "catch": 15,
    "stumping": 20,
    "runOut": 12
  },
  "milestones": {
    "halfCentury": {
      "enabled": true,
      "threshold": 50,
      "points": 15
    },
    "century": {
      "enabled": false,
      "threshold": 100,
      "points": 35
    },
    "fiveWicketHaul": {
      "enabled": true,
      "threshold": 5,
      "points": 40
    }
  }
}
```

### Override Behavior
- **Priority**: League overrides take precedence over default sport rules
- **Immediate Effect**: Changes apply to next CSV upload
- **Previous Matches**: Existing scores remain unchanged
- **Reset to Default**: Delete overrides to restore default scoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No assets available for cricket sport"**
- Ensure cricket players are seeded: Run `python scripts/seed_cricket_players.py`

**"Invalid or missing rule" error**
- Check all required rules are present: run, wicket, catch, stumping, runOut
- Ensure values are numeric (integers or decimals)

**"Player not found" in CSV**
- Use correct `playerExternalId` values from seeded players
- Check spelling: `virat_kohli` not `Virat Kohli`

**Incorrect point calculations**
- Verify milestone thresholds: 50 (half-century), 100 (century), 5 (five-wicket haul)
- Remember bonuses are cumulative for runs-based milestones
