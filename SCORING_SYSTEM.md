# Scoring System - Friends of Pifa

## Overview
The scoring system fetches real UEFA Champions League match results from OpenFootball and calculates points for clubs owned by league participants.

## Scoring Rules

### Points Calculation
Each club earns points based on their real Champions League performance:

- **Win**: 3 points
- **Draw**: 1 point  
- **Goal Scored**: 1 point per goal

**Example:**
- Bayern Munich wins 9-2: **12 points** (3 for win + 9 for goals)
- Real Madrid wins 3-1: **6 points** (3 for win + 3 for goals)
- PSV draws 1-1: **2 points** (1 for draw + 1 for goal)

### Standings Tiebreakers
1. Total Points (descending)
2. Goal Difference (descending)
3. Goals Scored (descending)

## Data Source

### OpenFootball
We use [OpenFootball](https://github.com/openfootball/champions-league) - an open data project with UEFA Champions League match results.

**Data URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfootball/champions-league/master/2024-25/cl.json
```

### Mock Data Fallback
If OpenFootball is unavailable, the system uses mock data with 14 sample matches from the 2024/25 season including:
- Bayern Munich 9-2 Dinamo Zagreb
- Real Madrid 3-1 VfB Stuttgart
- Liverpool 3-1 AC Milan
- Arsenal 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain
- Barcelona 5-0 Young Boys
- And more...

## Database Schema

### LeaguePoints Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  leagueId: "uuid",          // Which league this is for
  clubId: "uuid",             // Which club
  clubName: "string",         // Club name for display
  wins: 0,                    // Number of wins
  draws: 0,                   // Number of draws
  losses: 0,                  // Number of losses
  goalsScored: 0,             // Total goals scored
  goalsConceded: 0,           // Total goals conceded
  totalPoints: 0,             // Calculated total points
  lastUpdated: "datetime"     // When scores were last computed
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### League Detail Page
**Standings Table:**

- Top 3 positions highlighted in green
- Displays: Rank, Club, W, D, L, GF, GA, GD, Points
- Real-time data from Champions League results

**Recompute Button:**
- Visible only to league commissioner
- Updates scores based on latest CL results
- Shows loading state while computing
- Refreshes standings automatically

**Scoring Info:**

- Scoring rules displayed
- Top 3 visual indicator

## Usage Flow

### 1. Create League & Auction
```bash
# Create league
# Start auction
# Managers bid on clubs
# Winners get clubs assigned to clubsWon[]
```

### 2. Compute Scores
**Option A - Via UI:**
1. Navigate to league detail page
2. Commissioner clicks "ðŸ”„ Recompute Scores"
3. System fetches CL results and calculates points
4. Standings table updates automatically

**Option B - Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/leagues/{league_id}/score/recompute
```

### 3. View Standings
**Via UI:**
- League detail page shows standings table
- Updates automatically after recompute

**Via API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/leagues/{league_id}/standings
```

## Scoring Logic

### Match Processing
For each club, the system:
1. Finds all CL matches where club played
2. Determines if club was team1 or team2
3. Checks match result (win/draw/loss)
4. Counts goals scored and conceded
5. Calculates points: (wins Ã— 3) + (draws Ã— 1) + (goals scored Ã— 1)

### Example Calculation
**Bayern Munich vs Dinamo Zagreb: 9-2**

For Bayern Munich:
- Result: Win â†’ 3 points
- Goals scored: 9 â†’ 9 points
- **Total: 12 points**

For Dinamo Zagreb:
- Result: Loss â†’ 0 points
- Goals scored: 2 â†’ 2 points
- **Total: 2 points**

## Cron/Manual Trigger

### Current Implementation
- **Manual Trigger**: Commissioner clicks "Recompute Scores" button
- **API Trigger**: POST to `/api/leagues/:id/score/recompute`

### Future: Automated Cron
To add automated scoring updates:

**Option 1 - Python APScheduler:**
```python
from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler

scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()

async def auto_recompute_all_leagues():
    leagues = await db.leagues.find({"status": "active"}).to_list(100)
    for league in leagues:
        await recompute_league_scores(db, league["id"])

# Run daily at 2 AM
scheduler.add_job(auto_recompute_all_leagues, 'cron', hour=2)
scheduler.start()
```

**Option 2 - External Cron:**
```bash
# Add to crontab
0 2 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/leagues/{league_id}/score/recompute
```

## Testing

### Test with Mock Data
```bash
# 1. Create league and participants
# 2. Assign clubs to participants (Bayern, Real Madrid, Liverpool)
# 3. Recompute scores

curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/leagues/test-league/score/recompute

# Expected results:
# - Bayern Munich: 12 points (1W, 9GF)
# - Real Madrid: 6 points (1W, 3GF)
# - Liverpool: 6 points (1W, 3GF)
```
