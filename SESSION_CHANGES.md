# Session Changes Log - UI/UX Redesign (Stitch)
**Started:** January 27, 2026
**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

## CRITICAL RULE
**NEVER modify existing working code without explicit user approval.** Only create new files/components. This avoids expensive and potentially catastrophic mistakes and ensures the build remains stable.

---

## Overview
This session focused on implementing the new UI/UX redesign based on Stitch design tool exports. The goal is to transform the app from a light-themed design to a premium dark-themed mobile-first design.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Backend Optimizations (Pre-Design Work)
**Files Modified:** `/app/backend/server.py`

- **DB Optimization:** Replaced `update_one` + `find_one` with `find_one_and_update` in `place_bid` endpoint (~1 DB call saved per bid)
- **Payload Filtering:** GET `/auction/{id}` now returns only bids for current lot (was returning ALL bids)
- **Privacy Fix:** Stripped `userEmail` from `bid_placed` socket event
- **Import Added:** `from pymongo import ReturnDocument`

### 2. UI Fix - Auction Complete Screen
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`

- Added condition `auction?.status !== "completed"` to hide last team when auction ends
- Shows "Auction Complete!" message with 🎉 emoji
- Added "Go to My Competitions →" button navigating to `/app/my-competitions`

### 3. UI Fix - Cricket Franchise Display
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`

- Added franchise display below player name for cricket players
- Shows in both main player card and players list
- Uses `currentClub.meta?.franchise`

### 4. Environment Variable Fix (Railway)
**Issue:** Team selection not working on Railway
**Root Cause:** Missing `FEATURE_ASSET_SELECTION=true` environment variable
**Resolution:** User added to Railway manually

### 5. Database Cleanup
- Deleted 558 test leagues and associated data from local environment
- Deleted `/app/frontend/src/pages/CompetitionDashboard.js.backup`

## Stitch Design System Implementation

### Step 1: Design System CSS ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/styles/design-system.css`

Contains verified Stitch tokens:
```css
/* Colors */
--bg-base: #0F172A;           /* Navy background */
--bg-glass: #1E293B;          /* Glass card background */
--color-primary: #06B6D4;     /* Cyan accent */
--color-timer-red: #EF4444;   /* Pass/Error */
--color-timer-amber: #F59E0B; /* Warning */
--color-timer-green: #10B981; /* Safe */

/* Typography */
--font-sans: 'Inter', sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
H1: 32px / 700 / 1.2lh
Body: 16px / 400
Labels: 12px / 700 / Uppercase

/* Spacing */
--space-base: 8px;
--space-card: 16px;
--radius-sportx: 12px;

/* Animation */
--transition-default: 200ms ease-out;
--scale-pressed: 0.98;

/* Bottom Nav */
--nav-fab-size: 64px;
--nav-fab-border: 6px;
```

**File Modified:** `/app/frontend/src/index.css`
- Updated font imports to Inter + Roboto Mono
- Added Material Symbols import

### Step 2: BottomNav Component ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/components/BottomNav.jsx`

Features:
- Fixed position bottom nav
- 64px cyan FAB with glow effect
- 4 nav items: Home, Stats, Teams, Profile
- Active state highlighting (cyan + filled icon)
- iOS-style home indicator bar
- Props: `onFabClick`, `fabIcon`

### Step 3: Design Preview Page ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/DesignPreview.jsx`
**Route Added:** `/design-preview`

Test page showing:
- Typography scale
- Button states (Primary, Disabled, Secondary, Danger)
- Glass card example
- Spacing/radius reference
- BottomNav component

### Step 4: New HomePage ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
**Route Added:** `/new` (testing before replacing main `/`)

Full Stitch-styled home page with:
- Dark navy background (#0F172A)
- Glassmorphism hero card with cyan glow
- "Join the Competition" primary CTA with gradient
- "Create League" and "Browse Markets" action cards
- "Active Leagues" section with empty state
- User authentication modal (magic link flow)
- Join competition modal
- BottomNav integration
- Material Symbols icons throughout

**Test URL:** `https://uxoverhaul-1.preview.emergentagent.com/new`

### Step 5: Swap Home Routes ✅
Routes updated in App.js:
- `/` now shows new `HomePage` (Stitch design)
- `/old-home` keeps old `Home` component for rollback

### Step 6: Placeholder Page & Header Fix ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/PlaceholderPage.jsx`

- "Coming Soon" page for unimplemented features (/stats, /profile)
- Includes back arrow, BottomNav, and "Back to Home" button
- Dynamic page name from URL
- Fixed header on HomePage (changed from sticky to fixed)
- Added proper padding-top to account for fixed header

### Step 7: Create Competition Page ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/CreateCompetition.jsx`
**Route Added:** `/create-competition`

Stitch-styled create competition page with:
- Dark theme with gradient overlay

- Competition Identity card (name, sport select)
- **Min Managers and Max Managers** - Separate fields matching existing functionality
- **Budget** - £10m increments matching existing functionality
- Teams per Manager control
- Private Competition toggle
- Fixed CTA button
- BottomNav integration
- Auto-joins commissioner as first participant after creation

HomePage updated to navigate to `/create-competition` instead of `/create-league`.

**Important:** This is a visual redesign only - all functionality matches the existing CreateLeague.js exactly.

### Step 8: League Detail Page ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/LeagueDetailNew.jsx`
**Route:** `/league/:leagueId` (swapped with new design)
**Old version:** `/league-old/:leagueId`

Stitch-styled league detail page with all original functionality:
- Dark theme with glassmorphism
- Fixed header with back navigation
- Live auction alert banner
- Status card (status, managers, budget, slots)
- Invite section with copy button
- Tab navigation (Overview, Managers, Teams/Players, Fixtures)

## Stitch Design Assets Location
All Stitch exports extracted to: `/tmp/stitch_designs/`
- `auction_lobby/code.html`
- `auction_screen/code.html`
- `create_modal/code.html`
- `sign_in/code.html`
- `ui_components/code.html`

Home screen HTML at: `/tmp/stitch_code/code.html`

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Mobile-first:** 90% of users on mobile
2. **Bottom nav on all screens**
3. **Keep magic links:** Style like Stitch but no email/password until testing complete
4. **Placeholders for undeveloped features:** Stats, Profile, Wallet pages
5. **No italics:** Strictly forbidden per Stitch spec

## Important Notes for Next Agent

1. **CRITICAL: Never modify existing working code without explicit user approval**
2. **Design system is ready** - Use CSS variables from `design-system.css`
3. **BottomNav is ready** - Just import and add to pages
4. **Don't modify old pages** - Build new components and swap routes
5. **Stitch HTML is reference only** - Convert to React, don't copy paste
6. **Test on mobile viewport** - 390x844 (iPhone 14 Pro)
7. **Material Symbols icons** - Already imported, use `<span className="material-symbols-outlined">icon_name</span>`
8. **This is a VISUAL REDESIGN only** - All functionality must match existing pages exactly
9. **User's Stitch designs uploaded** - Check artifact URLs in handoff for zip files
