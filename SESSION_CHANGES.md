## 2. Database Changes

### Railway Atlas (sport_x_poc)

**Sports collection seeded:**
```javascript
{
  key: "football",
  name: "Football",
  assetType: "club",
  uiHints: { assetLabel: "Club", assetPlural: "Clubs", currencySymbol: "£", currencyName: "Pounds" },
  auctionTemplate: { defaultBudget: 500000000, defaultTimer: 30, ... },
  scoringSchema: { win: 3, draw: 1, loss: 0 }
}
{
  key: "cricket",
  name: "Cricket",
  assetType: "player",
  uiHints: { assetLabel: "Player", assetPlural: "Players", currencySymbol: "₹", currencyName: "Rupees" },
  ...
}
```

**Assets collection:**
- 56 football teams (EPL + UCL) - imported from Emergent production
- 246 IPL 2026 players - seeded from Cricbuzz API

**EPL Teams:** Imported with `sportKey: "football"` added.

**IPL Players structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  sportKey: "cricket",
  externalId: "576",  // Cricbuzz player ID
  name: "Virat Kohli",
  type: "player",
  meta: {
    role: "Batsman",
    team: "Royal Challengers Bengaluru",      // For Browse tab display
    franchise: "Royal Challengers Bengaluru", // For filtering
    iplTeam: "Royal Challengers Bengaluru"    // Backwards compat
  },
  competitions: ["IPL 2026"],
  competitionShort: "IPL"
}
```

### Local Preview Database (test_database)
- Same IPL players seeded (246 players)
- Old non-IPL cricket players removed

---

## 3. Code Changes (NOT PUSHED TO GITHUB)

### File: `/app/backend/services/sport_service.py`
**Change:** Added `{"_id": 0}` to MongoDB queries to exclude ObjectId (fixes 500 errors)
**Lines:** ~24 and ~48
**Status:** ✅ Already pushed to GitHub (was needed to fix Railway)

### File: `/app/frontend/src/pages/ClubsList.js`
**Changes:**
1. Added state variables for filters:
   ```javascript
   const [selectedFranchise, setSelectedFranchise] = useState("all");
   const [selectedRole, setSelectedRole] = useState("all");
   const [totalCounts, setTotalCounts] = useState({ football: 0, cricket: 0 });
   ```

2. Added franchise and role extraction:
   ```javascript
   const franchises = selectedSport === 'cricket' 
     ? [...new Set(currentAssets.map(a => a.meta?.franchise).filter(Boolean))].sort()
     : [];
   const roles = selectedSport === 'cricket'
     ? [...new Set(currentAssets.map(a => a.meta?.role).filter(Boolean))].sort()
     : [];
   ```

3. Updated filtering logic to use dropdowns

4. Added Cricket Filters UI section with:
   - IPL Team dropdown (shows team count: "All Teams (10)")
   - Role dropdown (Batsman, Bowler, All-rounder, etc.)

5. Updated pageSize from 50 to 250 (backend caps at 100)

6. Updated "Showing X of Y" text to show "Showing first 100 of 246 players" when paginated

**Status:** ❌ NOT pushed - needs testing on competition detail page first

### File: `/app/scripts/seed_ipl_2026.py`
**New file:** Script to fetch IPL 2026 players from Cricbuzz API and seed to database
**Status:** ❌ NOT pushed - local script only

---

## 4. What Still Needs To Be Done

### Immediate (Before Push)
1. **Competition Detail Page** - The "Filter by Series" dropdown shows old data (Ashes, NZ vs England) with only 53 players. Need to:
   - Update to show IPL teams instead of series
   - Should show "Filter by Team" with 10 IPL franchises
   - Ensure all 246 players are accessible

2. **Test all changes locally** before pushing

### After Push
1. Enable cricket in Railway: `SPORTS_CRICKET_ENABLED=true`
2. Test full cricket auction flow on Railway
