**Started:** January 27, 2026
**Last Updated:** January 30, 2026 (End of Session 6)

---

## Session 6 Changes - January 30, 2026

### 1. UEFA Champions League 2025/26 Logo Integration ✅

**Priority 1 Teams (Playoffs):**
| Team | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Galatasaray SK | galatasaray.png | ✅ Added |
| PAE Olympiakos SFP | olympiacos.png | ✅ Added |
| Qarabağ Ağdam FK | fk_qarabag.png | ✅ Added |

**Priority 2 Teams (League Phase):**
| Team | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| FC København | fc_kobenhavn.png | ✅ Added |
| Paphos FC | pafos_fc.png | ✅ Added |
| SK Slavia Praha | slavia_prague.png | ✅ Added |
| Royale Union Saint-Gilloise | union_saint_gilloise.png | ✅ Added |

**Additional CL Teams:**
| Team | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Celtic FC | celtic_fc.png | ✅ Added |
| Rangers FC | rangers_fc.png | ✅ Added |
| SK Sturm Graz | sturm_graz.png | ✅ Added |
| AC Sparta Praha | sparta_prague.png | ✅ Added |
| GNK Dinamo Zagreb | dinamo_zagreb.png | ✅ Added |
| BSC Young Boys | young_boys.png | ✅ Added |
| FK Crvena Zvezda | red_star_belgrade.png | ✅ Added |
| FC Shakhtar Donetsk | shakhtar_donetsk.png | ✅ Added |
| Jagiellonia Białystok | jagiellonia_bialystok.png | ✅ Added |

**Process:** SVG → PNG conversion using `cairosvg` at 256x256px

---

### 2. TeamCrest Logo Backdrop Fix ✅

**Problem:** All logos had white circular backdrop, making them look worse than transparent originals.

**Solution:** Conditional backdrop - only dark logos get white background.

**File:** `/app/frontend/src/components/TeamCrest.jsx`

```javascript
const DARK_LOGOS_NEEDING_BACKDROP = [
  'tottenham_hotspur.png',  // Dark navy blue
  'newcastle_united.png',   // Black and white stripes  
  'juventus_fc.png',        // Black "J" logo
];
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Most logos display with transparent background (clean look)
- ✅ Dark logos (Tottenham, Newcastle, Juventus) get white backdrop (legible)
- ✅ IPL cricket logos now display beautifully without backdrop

---

### 3. Production Database Standardization ✅

**Problem:** Production DB (Railway/MongoDB Atlas) had short team names that didn't match logo mappings.

**Root Cause:** `seed_railway_poc.py` used short names like "Real Madrid" while logo mapping used official API names like "Real Madrid CF".

**Solution:** Created and ran standardization script.

**File:** `/app/scripts/standardize_team_names.py`

**Teams Renamed (21):**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Real Madrid | Real Madrid CF |
| Barcelona | FC Barcelona |
| Atlético Madrid | Club Atlético de Madrid |
| Athletic Bilbao | Athletic Club |
| Manchester City | Manchester City FC |
| Arsenal | Arsenal FC |
| Liverpool | Liverpool FC |
| Aston Villa | Aston Villa FC |
| Bayer Leverkusen | Bayer 04 Leverkusen |
| Bayern Munich | FC Bayern München |
| Inter Milan | FC Internazionale Milano |
| Juventus | Juventus FC |
| Paris Saint-Germain | Paris Saint-Germain FC |
| AS Monaco | AS Monaco FC |
| Brest | Stade Brestois 29 |
| Benfica | Sport Lisboa e Benfica |
| Sporting CP | Sporting Clube de Portugal |
| Feyenoord | Feyenoord Rotterdam |
| Club Brugge | Club Brugge KV |
| Union Saint-Gilloise | Royale Union Saint-Gilloise |
| FC Copenhagen | FC København |

---

### 4. Missing Teams Added to Production DB ✅

**New Teams (11):**
| Team | Country | League |
|------|---------|--------|
| SSC Napoli | Italy | Serie A |
| AS Roma | Italy | Serie A |
| SS Lazio | Italy | Serie A |
| Olympique de Marseille | France | Ligue 1 |
| Olympique Lyon | France | Ligue 1 |
| LOSC Lille | France | Ligue 1 |
| AFC Ajax | Netherlands | Eredivisie |
| FK Bodø/Glimt | Norway | CL 2025/26 |
| PAE Olympiakos SFP | Greece | CL 2025/26 |
| Qarabağ Ağdam FK | Azerbaijan | CL 2025/26 |
| SK Slavia Praha | Czech Republic | CL 2025/26 |

---

### 5. Duplicate Teams Merged ✅

**Problem:** Teams in both PL and CL had separate DB entries, causing duplicates.

**Solution:** Merged entries, combining `competitions` arrays.

**File:** `/app/scripts/merge_duplicate_teams.py`

**Teams Merged (4):**
| Team | Competitions After Merge |
|------|-------------------------|
| Arsenal FC | ['English Premier League', 'UEFA Champions League'] |
| Liverpool FC | ['English Premier League', 'UEFA Champions League'] |
| Manchester City FC | ['English Premier League', 'UEFA Champions League'] |
| Aston Villa FC | ['English Premier League', 'UEFA Champions League'] |

**Final Production DB Count:** 63 unique football teams

---

### 6. Logo Mapping Reorganized ✅

**File:** `/app/frontend/src/utils/teamLogoMapping.js`

- Organized by league (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, etc.)
- Primary entries use official Football-Data.org API names
- Backward compatibility section for short names (transition period)
- Clear comments for future maintenance

---

### 7. Documentation Updates ✅

**MASTER_TODO_LIST.md:**
- Updated phase: PRE-MIGRATION → POST-MIGRATION / PRE-PILOT
- Marked Railway migration as complete
- Added Stitch redesign completion
- Added logo integration work
- Reorganized priorities

---

### 8. FIFA World Cup 2026 National Teams ✅

**42 national team badges added** for qualified WC2026 teams.

**Location:** `/app/frontend/public/assets/clubs/national_teams/`

**Mapping:** `nationalTeamLogoMapping` in `teamLogoMapping.js`

**Teams by Confederation:**
| Confederation | Teams |
|---------------|-------|
| CAF (Africa) | Algeria, Cabo Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia |
| AFC (Asia) | Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan |
| UEFA (Europe) | Austria, Belgium, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland |
| CONCACAF | Canada, Curaçao, Haiti, Mexico, Panama, United States |
| OFC (Oceania) | New Zealand |
| CONMEBOL | Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay |

**Database:** 42 national team assets seeded with `type: 'national_team'` and `competitionCode: 'WC2026'`

---

### 9. Team Type Filter Added ✅

**Problem:** Clubs and national teams mixed together, hard to browse.

**Solution:** Added "Team Type" dropdown filter on ClubsList page.

**File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/ClubsList.js`

**Options:**
- All Teams (105)
- Clubs Only (63)
- National Teams Only (42)

---

### 10. Football-Data.org ID Integration ✅

**Problem:** Teams lacked `footballDataId` needed for fixture imports and score updates.

**Solution:** Created script to auto-populate IDs from Football-Data.org API.

**File:** `/app/scripts/populate_football_data_ids.py`

**Coverage:**
- 63 club teams: ✅ All have `footballDataId`
- 42 national teams: ✅ All have `footballDataId`
- **Total: 105/105 = 100% coverage**

**How It Works:**
1. Script fetches teams from Football-Data.org API (multiple competitions)
2. Matches by name (fuzzy matching + manual mappings)
3. Updates `footballDataId` field in database
4. Can be re-run for new teams

---

### 11. Preview Environment → Production DB ✅

**Change:** Preview environment now connects to production MongoDB Atlas.

**File:** `/app/backend/.env`
```
MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://darts_admin:***@cluster0.edjfwnl.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0"
DB_NAME="sport_x_poc"
```

**Benefit:** What you test in preview is exactly what you'll see in production.

---

### Key Findings This Session

#### Database Synchronization ✅ RESOLVED
| Environment | Database | Teams |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Preview (Emergent) | MongoDB Atlas (prod) | 105 |
| Production (Railway) | MongoDB Atlas (prod) | 105 |

**Both environments now use the same database.**

#### Railway API Routing
External curl requests to production `/api/*` routes return HTML instead of JSON. However, frontend browser requests work fine. This appears to be a Railway nginx/proxy configuration - not blocking users but impacts external API testing.

---

---

## Session 5 Changes - January 29, 2026

### 1. IPL Team Logo Integration ✅
All 10 IPL team logos processed and integrated. See detailed section below.

### 2. Design System Refinements ✅

#### Background Color Standardization
Standardized all pages to use the deep navy `#0F172A` as per Stitch design spec.

| Page | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| AuctionRoom.js | `#0B101B` | `#0F172A` ✅ |
| ClubsList.js | `#0B101B` | `#0F172A` ✅ |
| MyCompetitions.js | `#0B101B` | `#0F172A` ✅ |
| CreateCompetition.jsx | `#070B13` | `#0F172A` ✅ |

#### TeamCrest Glow Effect → Soft White Backdrop
Multiple iterations to solve dark logo visibility (especially Tottenham):

**Attempts:**
1. ❌ Cyan Halo - `drop-shadow` insufficient for all-dark logos
2. ❌ White Silhouette - `brightness(0) invert(1)` had inconsistent rendering
3. ❌ Glassmorphism Shield (8% white) - Too subtle
4. ✅ **Soft White Backdrop (85% white)** - Current solution

**Current Implementation:**
```css
/* Circular white backdrop behind all crests */
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);
border-radius: 50%;
/* Logo at 65% of container size */
```

**⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE (UI-002):** Shield-shaped logos (Fulham, Bournemouth) slightly overflow the circular container. Documented in MASTER_TODO_LIST.md with future options to explore.

#### Hero Watermark Implementation
Updated watermark to show original logo with slight desaturation at 12% opacity.
```css
filter: grayscale(50%) brightness(150%)
opacity: 0.12
```

### 3. Auction Room UX Improvements ✅

#### Bottom Navigation Removed
Removed bottom nav bar from auction room entirely - provides a more focused auction experience without navigation distractions.

#### Quick Bid Buttons Extended
Added +£20m and +£50m buttons for faster large bids.

| Row | Buttons |
|-----|---------|
| Row 1 | +£1m, +£5m, +£10m |
| Row 2 | +£20m, +£50m |

#### Delete/End Auction Restored
Added "End" button back to commissioner controls.

#### View All Modal - Queue Order Hidden
Changed from showing "#1 in queue" to just "In auction" - maintains gameplay strategy element of not knowing team order.

### 4. BottomNav Component (Global) ✅
Removed text labels from icons, now icon-only with title attributes for accessibility.

---

### 5. Waiting Room Redesign ✅
Implemented new Stitch-based waiting room design.

**Commissioner View:**
- Light beam effect background
- "AUCTION LOBBY" title with participant count pill
- Grid of glassmorphic participant cards with avatars (initials)
- Glowing cyan status dots for "Ready" state
- Solid cyan "BEGIN AUCTION" CTA button

**User View:**
- Same layout but with hourglass icon
- Pulsing "Waiting for Host..." indicator (no action button)
- Manages expectations - users can't accidentally tap start

**Shared Elements:**
- Inter font family
- 12px border radius consistency
- Deep #0F172A background with light beam effect
- Glassmorphism cards with backdrop blur

**Bug Fixes Applied:**
1. **League data race condition** - Added loading guard to ensure `league` data is loaded before rendering waiting room (required for `isCommissioner` check)
2. **BEGIN AUCTION button not clickable** - Fixed z-index issue where the fixed bottom container was behind other elements. Added `zIndex: 50` to container and `zIndex: 51` to button.

---

### 9. CORS PATCH Method Fix ✅ CRITICAL
**Issue:** PATCH HTTP method was missing from CORS `allow_methods`, causing all PATCH requests from the browser to be blocked by CORS preflight.

**File:** `/app/backend/server.py` (line ~6737)

**Fix:** Added "PATCH" to allowed methods:
```python
allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
```

**Affected Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Purpose | Frontend Usage | Impact |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| `PATCH /api/users/{user_id}` | Update user profile | Yes (`Profile.jsx`) | ❌ Blocked until fix |
| `PATCH /api/admin/assets/{asset_id}` | Update asset data | No (admin/curl only) | ✅ Unaffected |
| `PATCH /api/fixtures/{fixture_id}/score` | Manual score updates | Potentially | ⚠️ May have been blocked |

**Root Cause:** When the CORS middleware was originally configured, PATCH was omitted from the allowed methods list. This is a common oversight as PATCH is less frequently used than GET/POST/PUT/DELETE.

**Lesson Learned:** Always audit CORS configuration when adding new HTTP methods. Consider using `allow_methods=["*"]` in development or maintaining a checklist of all HTTP methods used.

---

### 7. Profile Page ✅ NEW
Implemented user profile page accessible from bottom nav.

**Backend:**
- Added `PATCH /api/users/{user_id}` endpoint for updating display name
- Validates name length (2-30 characters)
- Users can only update their own profile

**Frontend (`/app/frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`):**
- Avatar with user initials
- Editable display name with Save/Cancel workflow
- Email display (read-only)
- Sign-in methods section (Magic Link active, Google "Coming Soon" placeholder)
- Sign Out button
- Follows Stitch design system

**Route:** `/profile` (linked from bottom nav Profile icon)

---

### 10. Device/Screen Optimization Audit ⏸️ PAUSED

**Current App Optimization:**
| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Primary viewport | 360-448px | Mobile-first, constrained by `max-w-md` |
| Design approach | Mobile-first | Desktop shows centered mobile layout |
| Tailwind breakpoints | sm: 360px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px | Custom config |

**Supported Device Range (Top 95%):**
| Device Type | CSS Viewport | Coverage |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Small Android | 360px | ~25% |
| Standard iPhone | 375-390px | ~30% |
| Large iPhone/Android | 393-430px | ~25% |
| Tablets | 768px+ | ~15% |

**Status:** Initial audit completed. Paused pending specific user feedback on problematic screens/devices.

**Quick Fix Applied:**
- Profile page: Changed "Cannot change" to "Locked" with smaller font (`text-[10px]`) and added `truncate` to email to prevent text cramping on narrow screens.

**Next Steps:** Gather user feedback with specific device models and screenshots before implementing targeted fixes.

---

### 8. Homepage Navigation Fix ✅
**Issue:** Clicking on a competition from the home page navigated to League Detail (`/league/:id`) instead of Competition Dashboard.

**Fix:** Changed navigation target from `/league/${league.id}` to `/app/competitions/${league.id}`

**File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx` (line 432)

**Result:** Users now land on the Competition Dashboard where they can access Summary, League Table, Fixtures, etc.

---

### 6. Deferred: "Pass This Round" Button
**Status:** UI exists but shows "Coming soon!" toast. Backend not implemented.

**Decision:** Deferred until after pilot testing. Touching core auction logic is too risky at this stage.

**Revisit if:** Users report frustration waiting 30 seconds for unwanted teams to time out during pilot.

**Full analysis documented in:** MASTER_TODO_LIST.md (Deferred Features section)

---

### ~~Upcoming: Waiting Room Redesign~~ ✅ COMPLETED
Based on Stitch designs, implementing new waiting room views:

**Commissioner View:**
- Grid of glassmorphic participant cards
- Prominent "BEGIN AUCTION" CTA button
- Glowing status dots for "Ready" state

**User View:**
- Pulsing "Waiting for Host..." indicator
- No start button (manages expectations)
- Social presence with real-time participant list

**Shared Elements:**
- Inter/Roboto typography stack
- 12px border radius consistency
- Deep #0F172A background
- Glassmorphism effects

---

## IPL Team Logo Integration - January 29, 2026

### Completed
All 10 IPL team logos have been processed and integrated into the app.

**Files added to `/app/frontend/public/assets/clubs/cricket/`:**
| Team | File | Size | Status |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Chennai Super Kings | chennai_super_kings.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Mumbai Indians | mumbai_indians.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Delhi Capitals | delhi_capitals.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Kolkata Knight Riders | kolkata_knight_riders.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Gujarat Titans | gujarat_titans.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Punjab Kings | punjab_kings.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Rajasthan Royals | rajasthan_royals.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Royal Challengers Bengaluru | royal_challengers_bangalore.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Sunrisers Hyderabad | sunrisers_hyderabad.png | 256x256 | ✅ |
| Lucknow Super Giants | lucknow_super_giants.png | 256x256 | ✅ |

**Mapping file updated:** `/app/frontend/src/utils/teamLogoMapping.js`
- Added all 10 IPL teams to `cricketLogoMapping` object
- Added alias for "Royal Challengers Bangalore" → same PNG file

**Process used:**
1. User provided vector logo zip files (from logobase.net and logoshape.com)
2. Extracted SVG files using Python zipfile
3. Converted SVG → PNG using `cairosvg` with 256x256 dimensions and transparent background
4. Copied to `/app/frontend/public/assets/clubs/cricket/`
5. Updated mapping in `teamLogoMapping.js`

**Note on CSK logo size:**
The Chennai Super Kings logo appears visually smaller than others (e.g., Punjab Kings) despite all being 256x256 pixels. This is due to the logo design itself - CSK's lion figure only fills ~30% of the canvas, while Punjab Kings fills ~76%. This is inherent to the source artwork and not a bug.

---

## CRITICAL ERRORS - January 27, 2026

### Agent Mistakes Acknowledged
The agent deviated from clear user instructions. The user requested a **VISUAL REDESIGN ONLY** - changing CSS/styling on existing working code. Instead, the agent:

1. **Created new files** (`LeagueDetailStitched.jsx`, `AuctionRoomStitched.jsx`) instead of styling existing files
2. **Rewrote code** which introduced bugs:
   - Join flow broken (wrong API endpoint)
   - Missing `activeAuctionId` in League model
   - User 2 couldn't see "Join Auction" button
3. **Wasted user's time and money** debugging issues that should never have existed
4. **Failed to follow explicit instructions** despite repeated reminders

### Fixes Applied
- Added `POST /api/leagues/join` endpoint to backend (to fix join flow)
- Added `activeAuctionId` field to League model in `models.py`
- Updated `start_auction` endpoint to set `activeAuctionId` on league
- Removed incorrectly added red "Auction is Live" banner from `LeagueDetail.js`

### Current Status (Jan 27, 2026)
- **LeagueDetailStitched.jsx** - NOW WORKING with tabs UX improvement
- **User 2 can join waiting room** - VERIFIED WORKING
- **AuctionRoom.js** - VISUAL STYLING COMPLETE ✅

### Bug Fix - January 27, 2026 (Session 3)
**Issue:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')` error when accessing auction room without being logged in
**Root Cause:** The waiting room UI rendered before the auth check, causing `user.id` to be accessed when `user` was null
**Fix:** Moved the auth check before the waiting room render and added optional chaining (`user && p.userId === user.id`)

### Correct Approach Going Forward
- **DO:** Modify existing `AuctionRoom.js` by changing only CSS classes and inline styles
- **DO NOT:** Create new files or rewrite any logic
- **DO NOT:** Change API calls, state management, or any functionality
- **VERIFY:** Test each change before moving to next

---

## CRITICAL RULE
**NEVER modify existing working code logic. Only change visual styling (CSS classes, inline styles).**

---

## Overview
This session focused on implementing the new UI/UX redesign based on Stitch design tool exports. The goal is to transform the app from a light-themed design to a premium dark-themed mobile-first design.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Backend Optimizations (Pre-Design Work)
**Files Modified:** `/app/backend/server.py`

- **DB Optimization:** Replaced `update_one` + `find_one` with `find_one_and_update` in `place_bid` endpoint (~1 DB call saved per bid)
- **Payload Filtering:** GET `/auction/{id}` now returns only bids for current lot (was returning ALL bids)
- **Privacy Fix:** Stripped `userEmail` from `bid_placed` socket event
- **Import Added:** `from pymongo import ReturnDocument`

### 2. UI Fix - Auction Complete Screen
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`

- Added condition `auction?.status !== "completed"` to hide last team when auction ends
- Shows "Auction Complete!" message with 🎉 emoji
- Added "Go to My Competitions →" button navigating to `/app/my-competitions`

### 3. UI Fix - Cricket Franchise Display
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`

- Added franchise display below player name for cricket players
- Shows in both main player card and players list
- Uses `currentClub.meta?.franchise`

### 4. Environment Variable Fix (Railway)
**Issue:** Team selection not working on Railway
**Root Cause:** Missing `FEATURE_ASSET_SELECTION=true` environment variable
**Resolution:** User added to Railway manually

### 5. Database Cleanup
- Deleted 558 test leagues and associated data from local environment
- Deleted `/app/frontend/src/pages/CompetitionDashboard.js.backup`

---

## Stitch Design System Implementation

### Step 1: Design System CSS ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/styles/design-system.css`

Contains verified Stitch tokens:
```css
/* Colors */
--bg-base: #0F172A;           /* Navy background */
--bg-glass: #1E293B;          /* Glass card background */
--color-primary: #06B6D4;     /* Cyan accent */
--color-timer-red: #EF4444;   /* Pass/Error */
--color-timer-amber: #F59E0B; /* Warning */
--color-timer-green: #10B981; /* Safe */

/* Typography */
--font-sans: 'Inter', sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
H1: 32px / 700 / 1.2lh
Body: 16px / 400
Labels: 12px / 700 / Uppercase

/* Spacing */
--space-base: 8px;
--space-card: 16px;
--radius-sportx: 12px;

/* Animation */
--transition-default: 200ms ease-out;
--scale-pressed: 0.98;

/* Bottom Nav */
--nav-fab-size: 64px;
--nav-fab-border: 6px;
```

**File Modified:** `/app/frontend/src/index.css`
- Updated font imports to Inter + Roboto Mono
- Added Material Symbols import

### Step 2: BottomNav Component ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/components/BottomNav.jsx`

Features:
- Fixed position bottom nav
- 64px cyan FAB with glow effect
- 4 nav items: Home, Stats, Teams, Profile
- Active state highlighting (cyan + filled icon)
- iOS-style home indicator bar
- Props: `onFabClick`, `fabIcon`

### Step 3: Design Preview Page ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/DesignPreview.jsx`
**Route Added:** `/design-preview`

Test page showing:
- Typography scale
- Button states (Primary, Disabled, Secondary, Danger)
- Glass card example
- Spacing/radius reference
- BottomNav component

### Step 4: New HomePage ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
**Route Added:** `/new` (testing before replacing main `/`)

Full Stitch-styled home page with:
- Dark navy background (#0F172A)
- Glassmorphism hero card with cyan glow
- "Join the Competition" primary CTA with gradient
- "Create League" and "Browse Markets" action cards
- "Active Leagues" section with empty state
- User authentication modal (magic link flow)
- Join competition modal
- BottomNav integration
- Material Symbols icons throughout

**Test URL:** `https://stitch-dark-theme.preview.emergentagent.com/new`

### Step 5: Swap Home Routes ✅
Routes updated in App.js:
- `/` now shows new `HomePage` (Stitch design)
- `/old-home` keeps old `Home` component for rollback

### Step 6: Placeholder Page & Header Fix ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/PlaceholderPage.jsx`

- "Coming Soon" page for unimplemented features (/stats, /profile)
- Includes back arrow, BottomNav, and "Back to Home" button
- Dynamic page name from URL
- Fixed header on HomePage (changed from sticky to fixed)
- Added proper padding-top to account for fixed header

### Step 7: Create Competition Page ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/CreateCompetition.jsx`
**Route Added:** `/create-competition`

Stitch-styled create competition page with:
- Dark theme with gradient overlay
- Progress indicator (step 1 of 3)
- Competition Identity card (name, sport select)
- **Min Managers and Max Managers** - Separate fields matching existing functionality
- **Budget** - £10m increments matching existing functionality
- Teams per Manager control
- Private Competition toggle
- Fixed CTA button
- BottomNav integration
- Auto-joins commissioner as first participant after creation

HomePage updated to navigate to `/create-competition` instead of `/create-league`.

**Important:** This is a visual redesign only - all functionality matches the existing CreateLeague.js exactly.

### Step 8: League Detail Page ✅
**File Created:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/LeagueDetailNew.jsx`
**Route:** `/league/:leagueId` (swapped with new design)
**Old version:** `/league-old/:leagueId`

Stitch-styled league detail page with all original functionality:
- Dark theme with glassmorphism
- Fixed header with back navigation
- Live auction alert banner
- Status card (status, managers, budget, slots)
- Invite section with copy button
- Tab navigation (Overview, Managers, Teams/Players, Fixtures)
- Commissioner actions (Manage Teams, Import Fixtures, Start Auction)
- Standings preview
- Full-screen Manage Assets modal
- BottomNav integration

---

## Pending Work (Next Steps)

### Step 9: Auction Room ✅ COMPLETE - TESTED
Applied Stitch design to AuctionRoom.js - includes waiting room + live auction

**Completed styling:**
- Dark navy background (#0B101B)
- Glassmorphism cards (#151C2C)
- Cyan accent colors (#00F0FF)
- Timer with color states (normal/warning/paused)
- Quick bid buttons (+1m, +5m, +10m, +50m)
- "Pass This Round" placeholder button
- Bid history with winning bid highlight
- Manager budgets horizontal scroll
- Clubs overview stats grid

**Bug fixed:** Auth check moved before waiting room to prevent crash when user is null

### Step 10: MyCompetitions (NEXT)
My Competitions page redesign

### Step 11: ClubsList (Research Hub)

## BUGS INTRODUCED BY PREVIOUS REDESIGN (Fixed Jan 27, 2026)

### BUG: Join Competition via Invite Token - "Method Not Allowed"
**Root Cause:** When `HomePage.jsx` was created during the Stitch redesign, the previous agent changed the API integration logic (NOT visual-only):

**OLD (working) flow in App.js:**
1. `GET /api/leagues/by-token/{token}` - find league by token
2. `POST /api/leagues/{league_id}/join` - join with known league ID

**NEW (broken) flow in HomePage.jsx:**
1. `POST /api/leagues/join` - single call with just token (endpoint didn't exist!)

**Fix Applied:**
- Added new endpoint `POST /api/leagues/join` to `/app/backend/server.py`
- This endpoint looks up the league by token and joins in one call

**LESSON:** This is exactly why "visual-only redesign" must be enforced strictly. The previous agent inadvertently changed functionality when creating HomePage.jsx.

## Stitch Design Assets Location
All Stitch exports extracted to: `/tmp/stitch_designs/`
- `auction_lobby/code.html`
- `auction_screen/code.html`
- `create_modal/code.html`
- `sign_in/code.html`
- `ui_components/code.html`

Home screen HTML at: `/tmp/stitch_code/code.html`

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Mobile-first:** 90% of users on mobile
2. **Bottom nav on all screens**
3. **Keep magic links:** Style like Stitch but no email/password until testing complete
4. **Placeholders for undeveloped features:** Stats, Profile, Wallet pages
5. **No italics:** Strictly forbidden per Stitch spec

## Important Notes for Next Agent

1. **CRITICAL: Never modify existing working code without explicit user approval**
2. **Design system is ready** - Use CSS variables from `design-system.css`
3. **BottomNav is ready** - Just import and add to pages
4. **Don't modify old pages** - Build new components and swap routes
5. **Stitch HTML is reference only** - Convert to React, don't copy paste
6. **Test on mobile viewport** - 390x844 (iPhone 14 Pro)
7. **Material Symbols icons** - Already imported, use `<span className="material-symbols-outlined">icon_name</span>`
8. **This is a VISUAL REDESIGN only** - All functionality must match existing pages exactly
9. **User's Stitch designs uploaded** - Check artifact URLs in handoff for zip files
