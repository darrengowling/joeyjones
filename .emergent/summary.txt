The AI engineer has significantly advanced the multi-sport auction application, progressing from initial setup and bug fixes to enhancing UI/UX and implementing a major new feature. Key achievements include stabilizing auction mechanics, ensuring sport-specific terminology, and creating comprehensive pilot readiness documentation. A major focus was on implementing the Match-by-Match Breakdown feature, which required developing a new backend endpoint, integrating a frontend tab, and robust data reconciliation and debugging due to inconsistent database entries and field names. The engineer also addressed numerous UI/UX improvements, replacing browser alerts with toast notifications, implementing loading states, improving form spacing, and fixing mobile header responsiveness. The current state involves preparing for the final match score upload, with a minor data validation issue pending.

The application, originally a UEFA club auction platform, has expanded into a multi-sport (Football, Cricket) auction system supporting real-time bidding, roster limits, and commissioner-configurable timers. Recent efforts focused on:
1.  **Cricket Functionality**: Setting up NZ vs. ENG ODI series, including player seeding, flexible league rules, real fixtures, and CSV-based scoring (1pt run, 20pt wicket, 10pt catch/stumping/run-out). Strategy guides were also created.
2.  **Auction Fixes**: Activating the bid button, fixing timer restarts, resolving Pydantic validation errors, clearing last winning bid display, and using sport-specific UI text (e.g., Current Player).
3.  **Fixture & Scoring**: Improving CSV import (international matches, asset names), fixture deletion, displaying , ,  in standings, and adding a score upload UI.
4.  **External Integrations**: Shadow testing live cricket data APIs and web scraping, ultimately settling on manual CSV and planning AI-extraction for future.
5.  **Pilot Readiness**: Consolidating previous and current assessments for a 150-user pilot.
6.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Replacing  with  notifications, adding loading states, improving form spacing, and fixing mobile header responsiveness.
7.  **Match-by-Match Breakdown**: A new feature to display manager-specific player/team scores across multiple matches in a dedicated tab on the Competition Dashboard, sorted by total points.
8.  **Match ID Management**: Ensuring CSV  matches fixture's  and auto-updating fixture status upon score ingestion.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was facilitating the user's upload of match scores for the latest and final match of the NZ vs. England ODI series. The user provided a CSV file () for review. The AI engineer analyzed the CSV and identified a critical issue: the  in the provided CSV was incorrect (it was  instead of the expected ). The AI engineer informed the user about this discrepancy and requested a corrected CSV file to ensure a successful upload and proper integration into the newly implemented Match-by-Match Breakdown tab and the auto-updating fixture status. The user has acknowledged this, but has not yet provided the corrected file.
