The trajectory details the iterative development of a real-time UEFA club auction application, starting from forking an existing repository. The initial phase focused on setting up the core architecture: a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend, interconnected via REST APIs and Socket.IO for real-time bidding.

Key features were added incrementally based on user requests: league creation with manager limits and budgets, user authentication (simplified to name/email), invite tokens, a scoring system pulling data from an external API (OpenFootball), rebranding, and league deletion.

Significant time was spent on debugging. A major challenge was establishing a stable Socket.IO connection, which was ultimately resolved by correctly prefixing the websocket path with  to align with Kubernetes ingress rules. Another recurring issue was  exceptions from attempting to serialize non-JSON-compatible objects from MongoDB (like  and ) when emitting Socket.IO events; these were fixed by proper data conversion before transmission.

The project is currently in a fragile state. The user's final message expresses significant frustration with the application's usability, citing stuck timers, the need for manual refreshes, and an unusable UI cluttered with old test data. The immediate priority is to stabilize the application and clean the environment.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a Friends of Pifa web application where users can participate in real-time auctions for UEFA Champions League (UCL) clubs.

**Core Functionality:**
- **Leagues:** Users can create leagues with specific rules (budget, manager count, club slots). The league creator is the commissioner.
- **Clubs:** The system must be seeded with UCL clubs, initially from a static list and later from the OpenFootball API.
- **Auctions:** The commissioner can start an auction for a league once the minimum number of managers have joined. Clubs are nominated automatically in a random order.
- **Bidding:** Users can bid on the active club. Bids must not exceed their remaining budget. An anti-snipe feature extends the auction timer if a bid is placed in the final seconds.
- **Real-Time Updates:** All auction events (new lot, new bid, timer updates) must be broadcast to all participants in real-time using Socket.IO.
- **User Management:** A simple authentication system (name/email) is required. Users can join leagues using short, unique invite tokens. A logout feature is necessary.

**Additional Features:**
- **Scoring System:** A service to fetch real-world UCL match results from OpenFootball and award points to clubs (and thus their owners) based on wins, draws, and goals.
- **League Deletion:** Commissioners must be able to delete leagues they created, which should cascade-delete all associated auctions and bids.
- **UI/UX:** Rebrand the application to Friends of Pifa. The UI should clearly display the active club, highest bid, time remaining, and all participants' budgets. For active leagues, a Go to Auction button should be shown instead of Start Auction.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python web framework), Pydantic (data validation), Motor (async MongoDB driver).
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript library), .
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL database).
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO for WebSocket-based, bidirectional event communication between the server and clients.
- **API:** RESTful principles for creating, reading, and deleting resources like leagues and users.
- **Deployment Context:** Kubernetes environment where backend routes must be prefixed with  to be routed correctly by the ingress controller.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a separate frontend and backend.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the core of the application. It initializes the FastAPI app, connects to MongoDB, sets up the Socket.IO server, and defines all REST API endpoints and Socket.IO event handlers.
  - **Changes:** This file was heavily modified throughout the trajectory. Key changes include: adding endpoints for leagues, users, bids, and scoring; implementing all Socket.IO logic for joining rooms, placing bids, and broadcasting state; and critical bug fixes related to JSON serialization ( instead of , converting ) and moving the Socket.IO path to .

- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines the data structures for the entire application using Pydantic models. This ensures data consistency between the API, the database, and the application logic.
  - **Changes:** Models for , , , , , , and  were created and updated to include new fields like , , and budget tracking.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the primary user-facing component for the auction itself. It handles connecting to the Socket.IO server, listening for real-time events, displaying the current lot, timer, bids, and participant budgets, and allows the user to place bids.
  - **Changes:** It was significantly refactored to handle real-time state synchronization ( event), calculate time remaining from , and remove manual auction controls in favor of auto-progression. The Socket.IO connection logic was updated to use the correct  path.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main entry point for the React application, responsible for routing and global state management (like the current user).
  - **Changes:** Routes were added for the new pages (, ). Logic was added to manage user state (sign-in, logout) and to convert the Create League page into a modal dialog.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This page acts as a lobby for a specific league. It displays league details and participants, and it's where the commissioner starts the auction.
  - **Changes:** Logic was added to gate the Start Auction button until the minimum number of managers join. A Go to Auction button was later added for leagues with an already active auction. A standings table was also added to display results from the scoring service.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Clean up all existing test data (leagues, auctions, users) to provide a clean and usable environment for testers.
- Address UI instability that requires manual browser refreshes to see updated state.
- Implement a Restart Auction button for stuck or failed auctions.
- Ensure the bid history is reliably displayed on the auction page.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a difficult debugging session to fix a series of critical, cascading bugs. The primary issue was that the Socket.IO connection was failing because its path () was not prefixed with , which is required by the Kubernetes ingress controller for routing to the backend. This root cause was fixed by moving the Socket.IO endpoint to  on both the server and client.

Immediately following this fix, another bug caused an auction timer to freeze. This was traced to a  in the backend, where a  object was not being properly serialized to JSON before being emitted in a Socket.IO event. The AI fixed this serialization issue as well.

However, the user is extremely frustrated with the application's overall state, describing it as a shamble due to the accumulation of confusing test data and persistent UI/UX issues like stuck auctions and the need for manual refreshes. The AI's last action was to acknowledge the user's frustration and agree to clean up the application and fix the outstanding problems. The immediate task is to restore the user's confidence by stabilizing the application.

<optional_next_step>
I will start by creating a script to clear all existing test auctions, leagues, and related data from the MongoDB database to provide a clean slate, directly addressing the user's complaint about the confusing and unusable state.
