The trajectory chronicles the intensive debugging and refactoring of a real-time UEFA club auction application. The initial state was highly unstable, with the user expressing significant frustration over a non-functional UI, stuck timers, and confusing test data.

The first phase focused on stabilization. This involved a complete database cleanup, followed by systematic backend fixes for Pydantic serialization ( to ) and timezone-aware datetimes. However, the core problem persisted: a broken real-time auction timer.

The second, most challenging phase involved a deep dive into the timer synchronization. Initial debugging pointed to a Socket.IO room-targeting issue, leading to a temporary workaround using broadcast events. This revealed the true root cause: a critical race condition and state management flaw in the React frontend, where stale data from a  event would overwrite real-time timer ticks.

This failure prompted a complete, user-specified architectural pivot. The timer system was re-engineered to be server-authoritative, using absolute timestamps (, ) and a monotonic sequence number () to guarantee consistency and reject stale events. A custom React hook, , was created to encapsulate this complex client-side logic, providing a stable and accurate timer. This fix was validated with a new Playwright E2E test suite.

With the core functionality finally robust, development shifted to new features: handling unsold clubs, adding commissioner controls (pause/resume), restoring league deletion, and finally, adding a club visibility sidebar to the auction room.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build the Friends of Pifa application, a real-time web platform for auctioning UEFA Champions League clubs.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Auction System:** A commissioner starts an auction for a league. Clubs are nominated randomly. The auction must be fully automated, advancing from one lot to the next without manual intervention.
*   **Real-Time Bidding:** Users bid on clubs in real-time. All state changes (new bids, timer updates) must be instantly reflected for all participants via a robust Socket.IO connection.
*   **Timer Synchronization:** The auction timer must be perfectly synchronized across all clients, resilient to network latency and stale data. It should support an anti-snipe feature that extends the timer on last-second bids.
*   **Unsold Clubs:** Clubs that receive no bids must be moved to a separate queue and re-offered at the end of the auction.
*   **Commissioner Controls:** The league commissioner must have the ability to pause, resume, and delete leagues.

**User Experience:**
*   **Club Visibility:** During an auction, users must be able to see a list of all available clubs (upcoming, sold, current) to inform their bidding strategy.
*   **User Management:** Simple user creation (name/email) and the ability to join leagues via unique invite tokens. The system must gracefully handle user errors, such as entering tokens with extra whitespace.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor (async MongoDB driver).
- **Frontend:** React, with a key custom hook () for state management.
- **Real-Time:** Socket.IO for event-driven communication.
- **Synchronization Strategy:** Server-authoritative state using absolute timestamps (, ) and a monotonic sequence number () to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
- **Testing:** Playwright for end-to-end browser automation testing to validate complex real-time UI interactions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with distinct  and  directories.



- ****
    - **Importance:** The application's core. It manages the FastAPI server, Socket.IO events, database interactions, and all business logic for auctions, leagues, and bidding.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file underwent massive refactoring. Key changes include:
        - Implementing a new server-authoritative timer event system. All timer-related events (, , , ) were standardized to emit a payload of .
        - Rewriting the  function to handle unsold clubs by moving them to an  queue.
        - Adding new API endpoints for commissioner controls (, , ) and for displaying all auction clubs ().

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main user interface for participating in an auction. It handles real-time data display and user interactions like bidding.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This component was completely overhauled to fix timer instability.
        - All direct timer state management ( for ) was removed.
        - It now consumes the  hook, making it the single source of truth for the timer display.
        - Event listeners were added for new commissioner actions (, ).
        - UI elements were added to display a sidebar of all available clubs, fetched from the new backend endpoint.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This new hook is the cornerstone of the application's stability. It encapsulates all the logic for client-side timer synchronization.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch to solve the timer issues. It subscribes to the standardized timer events, calculates clock skew between server and client, ignores stale events using the  number, and provides a smooth countdown using . It also includes proper event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Defines all Pydantic data models, ensuring type safety and data consistency across the application.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The  model was updated to support new features, adding fields like  (e.g., 'paused'), , , and . The  model's default budget was increased.

- ****
    - **Importance:** An automated end-to-end test that proves the core timer logic is robust and reliable.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Created to validate the new timer architecture. It launches a browser, starts an auction, and asserts that the UI timer behaves correctly, specifically that it does not jump back when receiving stale events and that anti-snipe extends the clock as expected.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Verify that the minimum budget rule (Â£1m) is enforced during the bidding process. The models were updated, but the bidding logic enforcement was not explicitly tested.
- Complete and thoroughly test the new Clubs List UI in the auction room to ensure it updates correctly as clubs are sold or become current.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to implement a feature allowing users to see all available clubs during an auction for strategic planning. This involved a two-part implementation:

1.  **Backend:** A new FastAPI endpoint, , was created in . This endpoint retrieves all clubs associated with the specified auction and returns them along with their current status (e.g., 'available', 'sold', 'current'). This endpoint was successfully added and the backend was restarted.

2.  **Frontend:** The  component was modified to support this feature.
    *   A new function, , was added to fetch data from the new  endpoint and store it in the component's  state.
    *   This function is called when the component loads and after key auction events (like a lot completing) to keep the list fresh.
    *   Work was underway to modify the JSX layout to add a sidebar that iterates over the  state and displays each club with its name, logo, and status, providing users with the requested visual reference. The backend has been prepared, and the frontend is in the final stages of UI integration.

<optional_next_step>
Test the new Clubs List feature in the auction room UI to ensure it correctly fetches, displays, and updates the status of all clubs in real-time.
