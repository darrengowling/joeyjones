# Master TODO List - Sport X Platform

**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all work items organized by deployment phase  
**Current Status:** Pre-Migration to Railway (EU-West)

---

## 📍 CURRENT SITUATION SUMMARY

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Platform** | Emergent (US-hosted) |
| **Core Issue** | UK users face ~700ms latency due to transatlantic network overhead |
| **Pilot Target** | 400 UK users |
| **Decision** | Migrate to Railway (EU-West/London) for optimal UK latency |
| **Migration Timeline** | Starting in a few days |

---

## 🚦 TASK PHASES OVERVIEW

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **🔴 PRE-MIGRATION** | Prep work before Railway migration | Now |
| **🟡 PRE-PILOT** | Work after migration, before 400-user pilot | After migration |
| **🟢 POST-PILOT** | Enhancements after successful pilot | After pilot success |
| **🔵 FUTURE** | Long-term roadmap items | TBD |

---

## 🔴 PRE-MIGRATION TASKS

*Tasks to complete before or during Railway migration*

### Infrastructure Decisions (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

| # | Item | What's Needed | Status |
|---|------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | **Railway Account** | Create account at railway.app | ❓ Pending |
| 2 | **MongoDB Atlas Cluster** | Create M10 in `europe-west2` (London) ~£45/mo | ❓ Pending |
| 3 | **Redis Cloud** | Confirm existing Essentials account is portable | ✅ Ready (256 connections) |
| 4 | **Custom Domain** | Purchase domain if desired (e.g., sportx.app) | ❓ Pending |
| 5 | **Apple Developer Account** | ~£79/year (needed for mobile apps later) | ❓ Optional for now |
| 6 | **Data Migration Approach** | Fresh start vs export/import existing data? | ❓ Decision needed |

### Code Changes Before Migration

| # | Task | Effort | Risk | Can Do in Emergent? | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|---------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Add `/health` endpoint** | 5 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ Yes - High confidence | ✅ Already done |
| 2 | **Environment variable audit** | 30 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ Yes - High confidence | ✅ Done (Jan 16) - No hardcoded URLs, ready for Railway |
| 3 | **Update CORS config** | 15 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ Yes - High confidence | Do during Railway setup - update FRONTEND_ORIGIN, CORS_ORIGINS |

---

### 🔐 AUTHENTICATION HARDENING (PRE-PILOT CRITICAL)

**Current State:** Magic-link infrastructure exists but token returned in API response (dev mode)  
**Required State:** Real email delivery + production security

**What EXISTS (Good Foundation):**
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Magic link tokens stored in MongoDB with expiry
- ✅ Token hashing (secure storage)
- ✅ Session management structure
- ✅ Rate limiting infrastructure exists

**⏸️ DEFERRED UNTIL SENDGRID SETUP**

All auth hardening items grouped together - implement as a single piece of work once SendGrid account and API key are available:

| # | Item | Current | Required | Effort | Risk |
|---|------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Email delivery** | Token returned in response | Send via email (SendGrid/Resend) | 2-4 hrs | 🟢 Low |
| 2 | **Remove dev token exposure** | `"token": magic_token` in response | Remove - only send via email | 5 min | 🟢 Low |
| 3 | **Rate limiting on auth** | Not applied | Limit magic link requests (e.g., 3/hour/email) | 1 hr | 🟢 Low |
| 4 | **Single-use tokens** | May allow reuse | Ensure token deleted after use | 30 min | 🟢 Low |
| 5 | **Shorter token expiry** | 15 min (OK) | Verify appropriate for email delivery | Config | 🟢 Low |

**Why deferred:**
- Rate limiting could inadvertently block stress testing (unique emails per test, but still a risk)
- All items should be implemented together once email delivery is working
- No security risk pre-pilot as only team is using the system

**Dependencies:**
- SendGrid account (free tier: 100 emails/day) OR Resend account
- API key added to environment

**Implementation Plan (do all at once):**
```
Step 1: Set up SendGrid/Resend account, get API key
Step 2: Integrate email service, create magic link email template
Step 3: Update /auth/magic-link endpoint:
        - Send email with link instead of returning token
        - Return only { "message": "Check your email" }
Step 4: Add rate limiting (3 requests/hour/email)
Step 5: Verify single-use token enforcement
Step 6: Test full flow end-to-end
```

**Estimated Total Effort:** 1 day  
**When:** After stress testing complete, before pilot invites go out

### Documentation to Prepare

| # | Doc | Status |
|---|-----|--------|
| 1 | Railway deployment guide | See `/app/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` |
| 2 | Environment variables list | In MIGRATION_PLAN.md |
| 3 | Rollback procedure | In MIGRATION_PLAN.md |

## 🟡 PRE-PILOT TASKS

*Tasks to complete after migration, before inviting 400 users*

### Critical - Must Have for Pilot

| # | Task | Effort | Risk | Confidence | Why Critical |
|---|------|--------|------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Stress test on Railway** | 2 hrs | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | Validate migration fixed latency |
| 2 | **Authentication hardening** | 1 day | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | Real email delivery, no token exposure |
| 3 | ~~**Sentry monitoring**~~ | 30 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | ✅ Done (Jan 17) - DSN configured, backend errors now tracked |
| 4 | **Database backup verification** | 1 hr | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | MongoDB Atlas M10 has backups - verify configured |
| 5 | **Verify all core flows** | 2 hrs | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | Create league, auction, scoring |
| 6 | **Update Operations Playbook** | 1 hr | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | Update `/app/docs/OPERATIONS_PLAYBOOK.md` for Railway |

**Target metrics after migration:**

| Scale | Target Success Rate | Target p50 | Target p99 |
|-------|--------------------:|----------:|----------:|
| 20 leagues (160 users) | ≥95% | ≤200ms | ≤1000ms |
| 50 leagues (400 users) | ≥90% | ≤300ms | ≤1500ms |

### High Priority - Should Have

| # | Task | Effort | Risk | Confidence | Benefit |
|---|------|--------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **DB Call Caching** | 2 hrs | 🟡 Med | ⚠️ Medium | ⏸️ Attempted Jan 16 - reverted due to bug. Needs more careful implementation |
| 2 | **DB Call Optimization #2** - Combine update+find | 30 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | -100ms per bid (find_one_and_update) |
| 3 | **DB Call Optimization #3** - Remove league query | 1-2 hrs | 🟢 Low | ⚠️ Medium | Part of caching approach above |
| 4 | **Commissioner auth checks** | 1 hr | 🟡 Med | ✅ High | Security - prevent unauthorized actions |
| 5 | **Frontend performance audit** | 2 days | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | React.memo for heavy components, debounce socket updates |
| 6 | **Error recovery patterns** | 2-3 days | 🟡 Med | ⚠️ Medium | Retry logic for transient failures, graceful degradation |

### Medium Priority - Nice to Have

| # | Task | Effort | Risk | Confidence | Benefit |
|---|------|--------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | ~~**Bidder status indicator**~~ | 2 hrs | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | ❌ Considered - not needed. Current bidder name next to bid is sufficient |
| 2 | ~~**Current bid label**~~ | 30 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ High | ⏸️ Review - already visible in main bid display |

### Device/Screen Responsive Audit ⏸️ PAUSED

**Status:** Initial audit completed Jan 29. Paused pending user feedback.

**Current App Optimization:**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary viewport | 360-448px (mobile-first, `max-w-md` container) |
| Tailwind breakpoints | sm: 360px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px |
| Design approach | Mobile-first; desktop shows centered mobile layout |

**Target Devices (Top 95%):**
| Device Type | CSS Viewport | Share |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Small Android | 360px | ~25% |
| Standard iPhone (12-15) | 375-390px | ~30% |
| Large phones (Plus/Max) | 393-430px | ~25% |
| Tablets | 768px+ | ~15% |

**Identified Potential Issues (from code audit):**
| Component | Issue | Priority |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Commissioner Controls | 4 buttons in single row may overflow at 360px | 🟡 Medium |
| Quick Bid Buttons | 3-col grid may be tight at 360px | 🟡 Medium |
| Waiting Room Grid | grid-cols-3 at 360px = ~100px per avatar | 🟢 Low |

**Quick Fixes Applied:**
- Profile page: "Cannot change" → "Locked" (smaller text, email truncation)

**Next Steps:**
1. Gather specific user feedback (device model + screenshot + issue)
2. Implement targeted fixes based on real-world reports
3. Consider BrowserStack testing for edge cases

### Monitoring Items (Watch During Pilot)

| Issue ID | Summary | Watch For |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| ISSUE-016 | Roster not updating | Race conditions at 7+ concurrent users |
| ISSUE-019 | "Couldn't place bid" | False reports (actually roster full) |
| ISSUE-020 | Team offered twice | Socket duplication |
| ISSUE-022 | "Unknown" manager names | Missing userName data |

### Infrastructure/Config Issues

| Issue ID | Summary | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| INFRA-001 | **CORS PATCH method missing** | ✅ Fixed Jan 29 | PATCH was missing from `allow_methods` in CORS middleware. All PATCH requests from browser were blocked. **Action:** When adding new HTTP methods, always verify CORS config. |

**PATCH Endpoints Audit (Jan 29, 2026):**
| Endpoint | Purpose | Called From |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PATCH /api/users/{user_id}` | Update user profile | Frontend (Profile.jsx) |
| `PATCH /api/admin/assets/{asset_id}` | Fix asset data | Admin/curl only |
| `PATCH /api/fixtures/{fixture_id}/score` | Manual score updates | Potentially frontend |

### UI/UX Bugs (Stitch Redesign)

| Issue ID | Page | Summary | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|---------|--------|-------|
| UI-001 | CompetitionDashboard | Tab height/centering issue on mobile | 🔴 Open | Tabs (Summary, League Table, Fixtures) appear cramped with text not vertically centered. Multiple fix attempts (py-5, h-14, inline styles with height:56px + flex centering) all show correctly in agent's preview but DO NOT appear on user's browser even after hard refresh. Suspected infrastructure/CDN caching bug - changes in code are confirmed but not being served to user. |
| UI-002 | TeamCrest (all lists) | Dark logos (e.g., Tottenham) hard to see on dark background + shield-shaped logos overflow circular container | 🟡 Partial | **Current solution:** Soft white circular backdrop (`rgba(255,255,255,0.85)`) with logo at 65% size. Works for most logos but shield-shaped crests (Fulham, Bournemouth) still slightly overflow. |

**UI-002 Options Tried:**
1. ❌ **Cyan Halo** - `drop-shadow` glow around logo. Insufficient for all-dark logos like Spurs (interior remains invisible).
2. ❌ **White Silhouette** - `brightness(0) invert(1)` filter. Inconsistent rendering, some logos showed placeholders.
3. ⚠️ **Glassmorphism Shield (8% white)** - Too subtle, Spurs still invisible.
4. ✅ **Soft White Backdrop (85% white)** - Current solution. Works for dark logos but shield-shaped crests overflow circle.

**UI-002 Future Options to Consider:**
- Use square/rounded-square backdrop instead of circle to accommodate shield shapes
- Dynamically detect logo aspect ratio and adjust container shape
- Create logo-specific overrides for problematic crests
- Source alternative logo files that fit circular containers better

### Deferred Features (Revisit Based on Pilot Feedback)

| Feature | Current State | Why Deferred | Revisit When |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **"Pass This Round" Button** | UI exists (shows "Coming soon!" toast) | Touches core auction logic - too risky before pilot | If users report frustration waiting for unwanted teams to time out |

**Pass Button - Design Decisions (for future implementation):**

*Proposed Logic:* If all participants pass on a team, auto-complete lot (team goes unsold, move to next).

*Implementation Scope:*
- Backend: New endpoint `POST /auction/{id}/pass`, track passes per lot, "all passed" check
- Frontend: Call endpoint, show pass count, disable after passing, reset on new lot  
- WebSocket: Broadcast `user_passed` event
- Risk: 🟡 Medium (touches auction flow, needs careful state management)
- Effort: 2-3 hours

*Open Design Questions:*
1. Show pass count? (e.g., "4/12 passed") or keep hidden until all pass?
2. Can user "un-pass" if they change mind?
3. Can user still bid after passing? (or locked out for that lot)
4. Does commissioner pass count the same as others?

## 🟢 POST-PILOT TASKS

*Enhancements after successful 400-user pilot*

### Mobile App Strategy 📱

**Decision:** Capacitor (wrap existing React app) → App Store/Play Store presence

| Phase | Approach | When | Trigger to Advance |
|-------|----------|------|-------------------|
| **Current** | Mobile-responsive web | Now | ✅ Already done |
| **Post-Pilot** | **Capacitor** | After successful pilot | Users want "real" app |
| **Scale** | React Native | If mobile is 70%+ of usage | Capacitor hitting performance limits |

**Capacitor Implementation (Post-Pilot)**

| # | Task | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add Capacitor to React project | 2 hrs | `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli` |
| 2 | Configure iOS project | 2 hrs | Requires macOS + Xcode |
| 3 | Configure Android project | 2 hrs | Requires Android Studio |
| 4 | Add push notification plugin | 4 hrs | For "Auction starting!", "You've been outbid!" |
| 5 | Handle deep links | 2 hrs | Open app from invite links |
| 6 | App Store submission | 4 hrs | Apple review: 1-3 days |
| 7 | Play Store submission | 2 hrs | Google review: hours to 1 day |

**Estimated total:** 1-2 weeks

**Costs:**
- Apple Developer: ~£79/year
- Google Play: ~£20 one-time

**Signs you'd need React Native later:**
- Users complaining about "laggy" mobile feel
- Need complex animations/gestures
- App Store rejections for performance
- Mobile becomes 80%+ of traffic

### 🏏 IPL 2026 Cricbuzz Integration (IPL2026-API)

**Status:** ⏸️ PAUSED - IPL 2026 series not yet in Cricbuzz API  
**Priority:** PRE-PILOT (Required for live scoring during IPL)

**Overview:**
- Cricket fixtures/scores imported via **Cricbuzz API** (RapidAPI)
- IPL 2025 series ID: `9237` - IPL 2026 TBC
- Need to match our player names to Cricbuzz player IDs for scoring

**Current State (Jan 2026):**
- ✅ 125 curated IPL 2026 players in database
- ✅ 100 players match Cricbuzz IPL 2025 names exactly
- ❌ 24 players not matched (new 2026 signings not in Cricbuzz yet)

**Players Not Yet in Cricbuzz (new 2026 signings):**
```
Jos Buttler, Cameron Green, Mitchell Starc, Kagiso Rabada, 
Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Glenn Phillips, Jason Holder,
Ben Duckett, Pathum Nissanka, Finn Allen, Matt Henry,
Akeal Hosein, Cooper Connolly, Varun Chakravarthy, etc.
```

**Name Variations to Fix:**
| Our Database | Cricbuzz |

| Phil Salt | Philip Salt |
| Mitch Owen | Mitchell Owen |

**Implementation Plan:**

| Step | Task | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Wait for IPL 2026 series in Cricbuzz** | Usually available ~2 weeks before tournament |
| 2 | **Get IPL 2026 series ID** | Query `/series/v1/league` or archives |
| 3 | **Fetch all squad data** | `/series/v1/{seriesId}/squads/{squadId}` |
| 4 | **Match players and add `cricbuzzId`** | Update `assets` collection with Cricbuzz player IDs |
| 5 | **Fix name variations** | Update DB or add aliases |
| 6 | **Test fixture import** | `POST /leagues/{id}/fixtures/import-next-cricket-fixture` |
| 7 | **Test score updates** | `POST /cricket/update-scores` |

**API Details:**
- **Cricbuzz via RapidAPI** (`RAPIDAPI_KEY`)
- See `/app/backend/rapidapi_client.py` - `RapidAPICricketClient` class
- Endpoint for squads: `series/v1/{seriesId}/squads/{squadId}`
- Player fields: `id`, `name`, `role`, `battingStyle`, `bowlingStyle`

### ⚽ FIFA World Cup 2026 Implementation (WC2026)

**Status:** ⏸️ PAUSED - Qualifying matches still outstanding  
**Priority:** PRE-PILOT (High demand expected from UK pilot users)

**Overview:**
- 2026 World Cup is expanded to 48 teams (up from 32)
- Hosted by USA, Canada, Mexico (June-July 2026)
- Some qualifying spots still to be decided

**Implementation Plan:**

| Step | Task | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Get final 48 qualified teams** | Wait for all qualifiers to complete |
| 2 | **Match team names to football-data.org API** | Use same `externalId` format for fixture imports |
| 3 | **Add teams to `assets` collection** | `sportKey: "football"`, `competitionShort: "WC2026"` |
| 4 | **Add "World Cup 2026" dropdown option** | In Create Competition modal (alongside EPL/UCL/AFCON) |
| 5 | **Backend auto-select** | When `competitionCode: "WC2026"`, pre-select all 48 teams |
| 6 | **Test fixture import** | Verify scores import from football-data.org API |

**Data Requirements:**
- Team name must match football-data.org API exactly
- Include `externalId` (football-data.org team ID) for fixture/score imports
- Include `country` and `competitionShort: "WC2026"`

**API for Fixtures/Scores:**
- **Football-Data.org** (`FOOTBALL_DATA_TOKEN`) - Used for EPL and UCL automatic imports
- See `/app/backend/football_data_client.py` for implementation
- WC2026 team names must match Football-Data.org team names exactly
- Check if Football-Data.org covers World Cup 2026 (competition code TBC)

**UX Flow (same as IPL):**
1. Create Competition → Select "World Cup 2026"
2. 48 teams pre-checked
3. Uncheck any if needed → Save → Done

### UI/UX Improvements

| # | Task | Effort | Risk | Benefit |
|---|------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | ~~Demote/remove "Explore" button~~ | 30 min | 🟢 Low | ⏸️ Keep for now - useful for browsing, may expand for team stats later |
| 2 | ~~Team count preview on create~~ | 1 hr | 🟢 Low | ❌ Considered - not needed. Users see teams on LeagueDetail page |
| 3 | Sticky tabs on mobile | 1 hr | 🟡 Med | ⏸️ Attempted - needs proper testing environment to implement |
| 4 | Collapsible sections in LeagueDetail | 2 hrs | 🟢 Low | Less scrolling |
| 5 | ~~Cricket bat icons for football teams~~ | 15 min | 🟢 Low | ✅ Fixed (Jan 17) - Removed fallback icons; teams now show flag if available, otherwise just country name |
|| 6 | **Multi-device responsive optimization** | 4 hrs | 🟡 Med | Consistent UX across iPhone, Samsung, Pixel. Currently optimized for 390px (iPhone). Samsung Galaxy A16 (412px, 20:9 aspect) and other devices may show layout differences. Add explicit breakpoints and min/max heights for key sections. |
|| 7 | **Emoji audit & replacement** | 2 hrs | 🟢 Low | Replace emojis with Material Symbols for consistent rendering and faster load (emojis can show text fallback briefly). Pages: AuctionRoom, Help, etc. |
|| 8 | **Team crest integration** | 4 hrs | 🟡 Med | Source correct Football-Data.org team IDs and update database. Re-enable crest fetching in TeamCrest.jsx. Current apiFootballId values are incorrect. |

### Infrastructure

| # | Task | Effort | Risk | Benefit |
|---|------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Google Analytics | 1 hr | 🟢 Low | Usage insights |
| 2 | MongoDB Atlas backups | Config | 🟢 Low | Data protection (M10 includes) |
| 3 | ESLint warnings cleanup | 1 hr | 🟢 Low | Cleaner builds |

### Code Cleanup Pass

*Lint errors and code quality issues found during development - fix in a dedicated cleanup session*

✅ **COMPLETED January 17, 2026**

| File | Line | Error Code | Issue | Fix | Status |
|------|------|------------|-------|-----|--------|
| server.py | 198 | F541 | f-string without placeholders | Removed `f` prefix | ✅ Done |
| server.py | 427 | E722 | Bare `except:` clause | Changed to `except Exception:` | ✅ Done |
| server.py | 1398 | F841 | Unused variable `asset_names` | Deleted the line | ✅ Done |
| server.py | 6178 | E722 | Bare `except:` clause | Changed to `except Exception:` | ✅ Done |

**Effort:** 30 min  
**Risk:** 🟢 Low  
**When:** During a dedicated cleanup session, not mid-feature

## 📊 EMERGENT vs RAILWAY COMPARISON

### What Can Be Done in Emergent (Current Platform)

| Task | Confidence | Risk | Notes |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| Bug fixes | ✅ High | 🟢 Low | Full code access |
| UI changes | ✅ High | 🟢 Low | Hot reload works |
| Backend logic | ✅ High | 🟢 Low | Full code access |
| DB schema changes | ✅ High | 🟢 Low | MongoDB flexible |
| New API endpoints | ✅ High | 🟢 Low | FastAPI routing |
| Socket.IO changes | ✅ High | 🟡 Med | Need careful testing |
| Environment config | ✅ High | 🟢 Low | Via dashboard |

### What CANNOT Be Fixed in Emergent

| Issue | Why | Solution |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **UK user latency** | App hosted in US, can't change | Railway EU-West |
| **More than 2 pods** | Platform limitation | Railway (scalable) |
| **Regional hosting** | US-only | Railway (choose region) |
| **Custom server config** | Managed platform | Railway (full control) |

### Risk Assessment for Emergent Work

| Risk Level | Meaning | Examples |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 🟢 **Low** | Safe to do, easy to test/rollback | Config changes, UI tweaks, simple fixes |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Needs careful testing, some dependencies | Schema changes, socket logic, auth changes |
| 🔴 **High** | Could break production, hard to rollback | Major refactors, core flow changes |

**Recommendation:** Do 🟢 Low risk tasks in Emergent now. Save 🟡 Medium for post-migration when you have better monitoring. Avoid 🔴 High risk until after pilot.

| UK latency | ~700ms due to US hosting | Railway migration planned |

---

## ❌ FAILED APPROACHES (Lessons Learned)

| Attempt | Result | Lesson |
|---------|--------|--------|
| MongoDB pool size increase | No improvement | Pool size wasn't the bottleneck |
| Remove diagnostic query (prod) | Made latency worse | Preview != Production behavior |
| Hybrid DB approach | Ruled out | App in US = UK users still have latency |
| Agent-created Atlas cluster | Unnecessary | Emergent provides managed MongoDB |
