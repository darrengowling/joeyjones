## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - MongoDB Performance Investigation

**Status:** PAUSED - Awaiting infrastructure decision  
**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026

### Problem Summary
Production bid latency is ~700ms avg vs ~360ms in preview environment. Root cause identified as **network latency to MongoDB Atlas**.

### Key Findings

| Environment | MongoDB Location | Min Latency | Avg Latency |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Preview | `localhost:27017` | ~306ms | ~360ms |
| Production | `mongodb.net` (Atlas cloud) | ~640ms | ~700-900ms |

**The ~300-400ms difference is pure network round-trip to remote MongoDB Atlas.**

### Attempted Fixes (Jan 10, 2026)

| Fix | Result | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Remove diagnostic query | ❌ Made worse in prod | Works in preview |
| Remove duplicate league query | ❌ Made worse in prod | Works in preview |
| Increase maxPoolSize (5→50) | ❌ No improvement | Pool size not the bottleneck |
| Both fixes together in preview | ✅ 50% improvement | Confirms fixes work, prod infra is issue |

### Why Fixes Work in Preview but Not Production
- Preview: DB queries are local (~1-5ms each)
- Production: Each DB query adds network round-trip (~50-100ms)
- With 7-8 DB queries per bid, the network overhead dominates
- Fixes reduce queries but can't eliminate network latency floor

### Options to Investigate

| Option | Effort | Impact | Risk |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| **1. Accept current latency** | None | None | Production stays at ~700ms |
| **2. Co-locate MongoDB** | High | High | Self-hosted or same-region Atlas |
| **3. Aggressive caching** | Medium | Medium | Cache invalidation complexity |
| **4. Reduce DB round-trips** | Medium | Medium | Atomic operations, query batching |

### MongoDB Connection Details (Production)
```
mongodb+srv://draft-kings-mobile:***@customer-apps.oxfwhh.mongodb.net/
?appName=bidding-tester&maxPoolSize=50&retryWrites=true&timeoutMS=10000&w=majority
```

### Test Results Archive

| Date | Config | Environment | p50 | p95 | p99 |
|------|--------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Jan 10 | 5 leagues, 6 users | Preview (with fixes) | 357ms | 407ms | 416ms |
| Jan 10 | 5 leagues, 6 users | Production (baseline) | 713ms | 818ms | 961ms |
| Jan 10 | 5 leagues, 6 users | Production (pool=50) | 709ms | 1220ms | 1453ms |
| Jan 10 | 20 leagues, 8 users | Production | 809ms | 1479ms | 2079ms |

### Files Created
- `/app/tests/multi_league_stress_test.py` - Automated stress test script
- `/app/tests/README.md` - Test instructions
- Results output: `stress_test_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` and `.txt`

### Next Steps (When Ready)
1. Decide on MongoDB infrastructure approach
2. If staying with Atlas: Implement aggressive caching (medium risk)
3. If moving MongoDB: Co-locate with application server
4. Consider Redis for auction state caching

### External Analysis References
- Claude analysis: Suggested removing diagnostic queries, caching (partially tested)
- GPT analysis: Suggested test harness fixes, atomic DB operations (not yet tested)

## 🔍 MONITORING - Needs More Data

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Evidence | Status |
|---|----------|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **ISSUE-016** | **Roster Not Updating** - User wins team but roster shows wrong count or "Full" prematurely | Suspected race condition under higher concurrency (7+ users) | Single report from "Ash friends test 2" (7-user auction). Not reproduced in 100s of 4-6 user tests. | 🔍 MONITORING |
| 2 | **ISSUE-019** | **"Couldn't Place Bid"** - User pressed bid button but bid didn't go through | Likely expected behavior (roster full) | Investigation suggests roster was full when bid attempted | 🔍 MONITORING |
| 3 | **ISSUE-020** | **"United Offered 2 Times"** - Same team appeared twice mid-auction | Frontend display bug or socket duplication | No recurrence reported | 🔍 MONITORING |
| 4 | **ISSUE-021** | **"Roster Lagged"** - Roster display showed incorrect/delayed data | Same root cause as ISSUE-016 | Linked to ISSUE-016 | 🔍 MONITORING |
| 5 | **ISSUE-022** | **"Unknown" Manager Names** - Some managers show as "Unknown" | Missing userName in participant data | Not recurring in recent tests (Dec 21) | 🔍 MONITORING |

**Decision (Dec 21, 2025):** All above issues moved to monitoring. Will revisit if they recur in larger group testing.

**Files:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`  
**Next Action:** Wait for reproduction with debug report capture.

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Fix | Risk | Benefit |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | **ISSUE-017 Phase 2** | **Backend Diagnostic Reads** - Unnecessary DB reads in bid hot path add latency | Diagnostic logging reads league + participants on every bid | Move diagnostic reads to async background task | 🟢 Low | ~20-50ms faster bid processing |
| 2 | **ISSUE-002** | **Commissioner Auth Checks** - Missing authorization checks on some endpoints | TODO comments never implemented (server.py lines 3436, 3555) | Add `require_commissioner` check to flagged endpoints | 🟡 Medium | Security improvement |

**Files:**
- ISSUE-017: `/app/backend/server.py` (bid hot path)
- ISSUE-002: `/app/backend/server.py` (lines 3436, 3555)

---

## 🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY - UI/UX

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Fix | Risk | Benefit |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| 6 | - | **Demote "Explore" Button** - "Explore Teams" has equal visual weight to Create/Join | Button hierarchy not optimized | Consider removing altogether - serves no critical purpose | 🟢 Low | Reclaims mobile space, clearer primary actions |
| 7 | - | **Bidder Status Indicator** - Users don't know if they're winning or outbid at a glance | No visual differentiation for current bidder | Add "YOU'RE WINNING" (green) / "OUTBID" (red) indicator | 🟢 Low | Major clarity improvement for auctions |
| 8 | - | **Team Count Preview** - Users don't know how many teams they'll get when creating competition | No preview shown after competition selection | Add "20 PL teams will be included" text after dropdown | 🟢 Low | Sets correct expectations |
| 9 | - | **Current Bid Label** - Bid input field lacks context for current bid amount | Only placeholder text, no label | Add "Current bid: £Xm" label above input | 🟢 Low | Clearer bidding context |
| 10 | - | **Sticky Tabs (Mobile)** - Dashboard tabs scroll away on mobile | Standard scroll behavior | Make tab bar sticky/fixed | 🟢 Low | Better mobile navigation |

**Files:**
- Explore button: `/app/frontend/src/pages/MyCompetitions.js`
- Bidder status: `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`
- Team count: `/app/frontend/src/components/CreateLeagueModal.js`
- Bid label: `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuctionRoom.js`
- Sticky tabs: `/app/frontend/src/pages/CompetitionDashboard.js`

## 🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Configuration

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Fix | Risk | Benefit |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| 11 | **ISSUE-003** | **Sentry Monitoring** - No automated error tracking in production | `SENTRY_DSN` not configured (code is ready) | User creates Sentry account, adds DSN to env vars | 🟢 Low | Visibility into production errors |

---

## 🔴 MIGRATION PRE-REQUISITES (Confirm Before Migration)

**Status:** AWAITING USER INPUT  
**Priority:** HIGH - Required before any migration work proceeds  
**Reason:** Previous agent assumptions led to unnecessary work (e.g., MongoDB Atlas Cluster0 setup). Migration plan accuracy depends on confirmed details.

| # | Item | What's Needed | Status |
|---|------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | **Redis Cloud Account** | Confirm connection string/URL from your Redis Cloud dashboard | ❓ Pending |
| 2 | **MongoDB Atlas Cluster0** | Clarify: Did you create this, or was it set up by an agent? Can it be deleted? | ❓ Pending |
| 3 | **Football-Data.org API** | Confirm API tier and rate limits (free tier may not support 250+ users) | ❓ Pending |
| 4 | **Custom Domain** | Confirm if domain purchased for production (e.g., sportx.app) | ❓ Pending |
| 5 | **Data Migration Approach** | Decision: Fresh start (re-seed) or export/import existing data? | ❓ Pending |
| 6 | **Staging Environment** | Decision: Separate Railway project for staging, or single project? | ❓ Pending |

**Why This Matters:**
- Agent cannot access external dashboards (Railway, Redis Cloud, Atlas, Football-Data.org)
- Previous assumptions about MongoDB configuration were incorrect
- Migration plan must be based on confirmed facts, not assumptions

**Action:** User to provide details when ready. Agent will update MIGRATION_PLAN.md accordingly.

## 🔵 POST-PILOT - Technical Debt

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Fix | Risk | Benefit |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | **ISSUE-008** | **Refactor server.py** - 5,917 line monolithic file | Rapid development, no time to split | Split into modular routers (auth, leagues, auctions, fixtures, scoring, assets) | 🟡 Medium | Maintainability, easier debugging |
| 2 | **ISSUE-009** | **Fixture Import Logic** - Fuzzy name matching for fixture imports | Legacy implementation | Use `externalId` instead of name matching | 🟡 Medium | More reliable fixture imports |
| 3 | **ISSUE-017 Phase 4** | **Consolidate Socket Events** - Two events per bid (`bid_update` + `bid_placed`) | Historical design | Merge into single `bid_committed` event | 🟡 Medium | Simpler client code, less state churn |
| 4 | **ISSUE-017 Phase 5** | **Socket.IO Bidding** - HTTP POST for bids adds latency on mobile | Current architecture uses REST for bids | Use Socket.IO emit with ack for bidding | 🔴 Higher | Faster mobile bidding, fewer failure modes |

---

## 🔵 POST-PILOT - New Features

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Fix | Risk | Benefit |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| 5 | **ISSUE-026** | **Scalable Fixture Template Management** - Updating CSV templates requires code deploy | Templates are static files served via hardcoded endpoints; frontend references specific filenames | Build admin UI for commissioners to upload/manage fixture templates per league, OR store templates in database with dynamic serving | 🟢 Low | No redeploy needed to update fixtures; scales to multiple leagues; reduces cost/friction of tournament updates |
| 6 | **ISSUE-001** | **Manual Score Entry UI** - No UI for manual score updates | Backend exists, frontend not built | Build score entry UI in CompetitionDashboard | 🟢 Low | Commissioners can fix scores without CSV |
| 6 | **ISSUE-011** | **Auction History Tab** - Can't review bid history after auction | Feature not implemented | Add history tab showing all bids, prices, winners | 🟢 Low | Post-auction review capability |
| 7 | **ISSUE-010** | **Custom Scoring Rules** - All leagues use same scoring rules | Hardcoded scoring | Add commissioner UI to customize points | 🟡 Medium | Flexibility for different tournaments |
| 8 | **ISSUE-012** | **Email Notifications** - Users must manually check app | No email integration | Integrate SendGrid for invites, reminders, results | 🟡 Medium | Better user engagement |
| 9 | - | **Payment Integration** - No entry fees or charity donations | Feature not built | Stripe Connect integration (see PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) | 🟡 Medium | Revenue capability, charity support |
| 10 | **ISSUE-024** | **Auto-Import Fixtures** - Users forget to import fixtures, scoring fails | Manual step easily missed | Auto-import fixtures when commissioner saves teams (Option A: trigger on `update_league_assets`) | 🟢 Low | Removes friction, prevents "no scores" confusion |

## 🔵 POST-PILOT - Infrastructure & Nice to Have

| # | Issue ID | Summary | Cause | Fix | Risk | Benefit |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| 11 | **ISSUE-013** | **Analytics** - No visibility into user behavior | Not implemented | Add Google Analytics | 🟢 Low | Usage insights |
| 12 | **ISSUE-014** | **Database Backups** - Risk of data loss | No automated backups | Configure MongoDB Atlas daily backups | 🟢 Low | Data protection |
| 13 | **ISSUE-004** | **ESLint Warnings** - Build output cluttered with warnings | Missing ESLint rule config | Add rule to eslintrc | 🟢 Low | Cleaner builds |
| 14 | **ISSUE-007** | **Cricket Error Messages** - Generic error messages for cricket | Insufficient error handling | Add specific error messages | 🟢 Low | Better user feedback |
| 15 | **ISSUE-005** | **LeagueDetail Scrolling** - Excessive scrolling on mobile | Long page design | Add collapsible sections or tabs | 🟢 Low | Better mobile UX |
| 16 | **ISSUE-006** | **"Complete Lot" Button** - Button may be redundant | Added for now-fixed bug | Monitor usage, remove if unused | 🟢 Low | Cleaner UI |
| 17 | - | **Rate Limiting** - Rate limiting function exists but not applied to endpoints | Deferred during development | Apply `get_rate_limiter()` to key endpoints | 🟢 Low | Protection against API abuse |
| 18 | **ISSUE-025** | **Rename Help to User Testing Guide** - "Help" button name not clear | Generic naming | Rename "Help" to "User Testing Guide" in UI | 🟢 Low | Clearer purpose for testers |

## ✅ RECENTLY RESOLVED (Dec 2025)

| # | Issue | Summary | Solution | Date |
|---|-------|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | **AFCON Data Fix** | Kenya shown instead of Cameroon in AFCON competition, incorrect fixtures | Admin endpoints to update assets in production, corrected fixtures CSV uploaded (36 group matches) | Dec 21 |
| 2 | **ISSUE-023** | Bid input race condition - rapid bidding caused typed amounts to append/inflate | Made bid input read-only, added +1m/+2m buttons (now: +1m, +2m, +5m, +10m, +20m, +50m) | Dec 21 |
| 3 | **ISSUE-018 Enhancement** | "Manage Clubs" modal showed all 74 teams even when PL selected | Auto-populate `assetsSelected` on league creation + default filter dropdown to competition | Dec 21 |
| 4 | **ISSUE-018** | Team Selection UX - LeagueDetail showed all 74 clubs instead of competition-specific clubs | Backend `get_league_assets()` now filters by `competitionCode` when `assetsSelected` is empty. PL shows exactly 20 clubs. | Dec 20 |

## ❌ FAILED FIX ATTEMPTS & AGENT ERRORS

### MongoDB Atlas Setup (Dec 2025) - UNNECESSARY WORK
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **What happened** | Agent set up external MongoDB Atlas cluster for production |
| **Why it was wrong** | Emergent provides managed MongoDB automatically - no external setup needed |
| **Impact** | User received confusing "inactive cluster" warnings, wasted time investigating |
| **Lesson** | **Do not set up external infrastructure without verifying it's actually needed** |

### Code Fix Failures (Dec 19, 2025)

| Issue | Attempted Fix | Result | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **ISSUE-016** | Remove `loadAuction()` from `onSold` handler | Broke countdown display between lots | REVERTED |
| ~~**ISSUE-018**~~ | ~~Auto-filter `loadAssets()` by competition~~ | ~~Multiple attempts failed~~ | ✅ RESOLVED Dec 20 - Backend fix in `get_league_assets()` |

**Lessons:**
- Agent made "incremental guesses" instead of thorough analysis
- Agent repeatedly ignored instructions to get approval before code changes
- Agent didn't check downstream dependencies before implementing fixes
- Agent set up unnecessary external services without understanding platform capabilities
- "Low risk" fixes can have hidden dependencies
- **Success (Dec 20):** Proper analysis of data flow before implementation led to clean backend fix

## 📋 MONITORING - Watch During Testing

| Item | What to Watch For |
|------|-------------------|
| Production stability | 520 errors, service unavailable |
| Self-outbid fix | Toast appears, input resets correctly |
| Bid lag improvement | Check console for tapToAckMs, serverLatencyMs |
| Roster updates | Does roster display update after winning? |
| "Complete Lot" button | Is it being used? If not, remove |
| Debug reports | Are commissioners using "Report Issue" button? |
| Bid input buttons | Are +1m/+2m buttons being used? Is read-only input confusing? |

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

**If proceeding with E1:**
1. Configure Sentry (code ready, need DSN) - 30 min - CONFIG ONLY
2. Rate limiting enable - CONFIG ONLY
3. Backend-only fixes (ISSUE-017 Phase 2/3) - lower risk than frontend

**DO NOT attempt without thorough analysis:**
- ISSUE-016 (Roster Not Updating) - has hidden dependencies
- ISSUE-018 (Team Selection UX) - partial fix only, frontend display broken
